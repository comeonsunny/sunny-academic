title: The Comparison of Combinations of Block Ciphers and its Models of Operation
summary: The Combinations of Block Ciphers and its Models of Operation are semantic security needed by ORAM schemes. We would like to compare the performance of these combinations and their models of operation to find the best combination and its model of operation.

## Description
The Combinations of Block Ciphers and its Models of Operation are semantic security needed by ORAM schemes. We would like to compare the performance of these combinations and their models of operation to find the best combination and its model of operation.

## Usage
### 1. Install the dependencies
```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y libtomcrypt-dev
sudo apt-get -y install gnuplot
```
### 2. Run the code
```bash
./experiment.sh
```
### 3. Plot the result
> The result is in the directory `generate/`
