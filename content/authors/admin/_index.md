Hi! I'm Changqi Sun. Thanks for visiting my homepage. 
I am looking for a like-minded mentor as my future Ph.D. supervisor. 

My research interests primarily lie in the privacy preserving and secure computatoin. My current works focus on protecting cloud users' data access pattern from leaking. Furthermore, I am striving to improve the efficiency of Oblivious Random Access Machine (ORAM), a cryptography primitive hiding the data access pattern. In addition, I am interested in the intersection of autopilot and artifical intelligence. 

I'm now a third year M.S. student in Computer Science at [College of Cyberspace Security, DongGuan University of Technology](https://cs.dgut.edu.cn/index.htm). It's very lucky for me to be advised by Professor [Rui Lee](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37071988400).
I have received another master degree in Finance from [The Center For Economic Research](http://www.cer.sdu.edu.cn/), [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) and was lucky to be supervised by [Aijun Lee](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/liaijun/zh_CN/index/604687/list/index.htm).
I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematics at [Northeast Forestry University](https://www.nefu.edu.cn/index.htm).
As an undergraduate student, I was lucky to collaborate with Professor [Liang Ding](https://science.nefu.edu.cn/info/1223/2274.htm) at [Science College](https://science.nefu.edu.cn/) to publish a paper [**Application of shearlet and wavelets in signal and image denoising**](https://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CJFD&dbname=CJFDLAST2016&filename=HLDZ201602022&uniplatform=NZKPT&v=qqgVrzQAwQp76MgW50x01ghdLI8qj47sDDeXf9n-x0VHqGgvkZZjPtp7VJM67cFv).
