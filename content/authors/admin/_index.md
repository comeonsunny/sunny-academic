Hi! I'm Changqi Sun. Thanks for visiting my homepage. 
I am looking for a like-minded mentor as my future Ph.D. supervisor. 
I'm now a third year M.S. student in Computer Science at [College of Cyberspace Security, DongGuan University of Technology](https://cs.dgut.edu.cn/index.htm). It's very lucky for me to be advised by Professor [Rui Li](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37071988400).
I have received another master degree in Finance from [The Center For Economic Research](http://www.cer.sdu.edu.cn/), Shandong University and was lucky to be supervised by [Aijun Lee](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/liaijun/zh_CN/index/604687/list/index.htm).
Changqi Sun is a MS student of Computer Science and Technology at the DongGuan University of Technology Cyberspace Security Lab. His research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. He leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks.
